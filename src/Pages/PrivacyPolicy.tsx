          non-mandatory data. If you provide us with the non-mandatory data
          listed below, we will use it to fulfill our contractual obligations

          activating the manual recording function on your motorcycle or
          deactivating automatic recording in the RIDER feature of the app. We
          will then not track your location, but in this case the data analysis

          provide further data to third parties like local breakdown services
          that is necessary for the processing of the request. This could
          include, for example data such as private address, nationality,
          gender, breakdown address, credit card or bank details, hotel booking
          information, data/place of birth, data concerning personal document
          (ID, passport etc.) which are necessary for the booking of hotels, the
          towing of your vehicle, your transport or other services you need.
          However, we do not receive and therefore do not process this data
          ourselves, which you may entrust to third parties or processors.
          However, this does not preclude processing by these third parties or
          processors on our behalf if they receive any of the aforementioned
          data from you. In special circumstances, this data may also be given
          to Pierer Industries AG. This could be, for example, if the costs for
          the corresponding service are particularly high or there are other

          this service specifically requested by you. Not providing your data
          would have the consequence that we would not be able to fulfil our
          contractual obligations. We process the not mandatory data based on
          your consent (Art 6 para 1 lit a GDPR). Please see the information
