        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm font-light">
          If you own a vehicle from the Pierer Mobility Group brands such as
          KTM, Husqvarna, or Gasgas ("Vehicle") and have registered and linked
          it with Pierer Mobility AG as part of one of our designated services,
          data collected and generated during the use of your vehicle, such as
          speed and condition data (collectively "Vehicle Data"), will be
          transmitted to us. Subject to applicable data protection requirements,
          you allow us to use the non-personal Vehicle Data and Service Data
          (collectively "Usage Data") for the purposes described below:

        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-300 text-sm font-light">
          <li>
            To fulfill these service conditions, particularly to provide the
            service and display usage data and the evaluations and analyses
            generated from it as part of the service. This also includes the
            necessary analysis, evaluation, aggregation, and processing of the
            usage data;
          </li>
          <li>
            To provide maintenance and repair services you have commissioned, as
            well as software/firmware updates, recalls, and product and service
            improvements for your vehicle;
          </li>
          <li>
            To aggregate, anonymize, analyze, and evaluate the usage data with
            the aim of subsequently utilizing the derived information.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm font-light">
          We may use the usage data for these purposes through our own employees
          and third parties acting on our behalf. We will obligate these third
          parties to use the usage data exclusively on our behalf and to treat
          the usage data confidentially. To ensure that you can access your
          vehicle data and usage data, please check before using the contractual
          goods that the Connectivity Unit Offroad is connected to your service
          account. You can stop the transmission of further vehicle data and the
          generation of further service data at any time with future effect by
          unlinking your vehicle from the service, deleting your account, or
          terminating the contract for the provision of the service.
          <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm font-light">
            We will delete usage data when it is no longer used for the purposes
            described above, but no later than upon termination of the contract
            for the provision of the service. Deletion will only be waived if
            the retention of the usage data is required to fulfill legal
            retention obligations or to assert, enforce, or defend legal claims
            within the applicable statutory periods.

          If you own a vehicle and have registered and linked it with Pierer
          Mobility AG as part of one of our designated services, you are
          obliged, in the event of temporarily providing your vehicle to a third
          party (e.g., by loan or rental), to inform this third party that and
          which personal data and usage data are processed and transmitted by
          Pierer Mobility AG concerning the respective vehicle (in particular,
          for which processing operations you have given consent to data
          processing to Pierer Mobility AG). Furthermore, you are obliged to
          inform this third party and obtain their verifiable consent that this
          personal data and the usage data recorded during the third party's
          rides remain visible to you and are processed by Pierer Mobility AG
          within your account and that the third party has no access to it.
          Additionally, you are obliged to obtain the third party's verifiable
          permission for the usage data to be used by Pierer Mobility AG for the
          purposes described in section 2 .
          <br /> <br />
          For vehicles equipped with a Connectivity Unit Offroad ("CUO"), you
          have the option to reset the CUO on the vehicle before temporarily
          handing it over ("CUO Reset"). In this case, no further data
          processing will take place within your account; however, the third
          party can set up their own account and register/link the provided
          vehicle to control the data collection and processing by Pierer
          Mobility AG and access it within their account. Please note that a
          connection to your account exists with a CUO reset, as you will
          otherwise no longer be able to access the data generated before the
          CUO reset through your account. When the vehicle is returned to you by
          the third party, a new CUO reset must be performed so that you can
          register, link, and access the data collected in the future within
          your account; if this new CUO reset is not performed, the data from
          your rides will continue to be processed and displayed in the third
          party's account.
